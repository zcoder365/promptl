a web app designed to motivate kids with learning differences write.

## earn points!
by writing a certain number of words in your stories, you can earn points! write over 70 words and use all 5 words in the prompt to earn points, and write over 100 words to get bonus points! (your words are tracked underneath the textbox where you write your story.)

## save your work!
click the "publish" button at the bottom of the page to save your work (don't worry, it isn't posted anywhere â€“ only you get to see what you've written!).

## edit prior stories!
you can view your prior stories and make changes to them by clicking "prior changes" in the navigation bar. this doesn't change the number of points you earn for the story though.
